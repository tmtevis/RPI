This project is a manufacturing support project I did at my first job out of college. The job called for a device capable of dispensing .01g of adhesive repeatedly.

The implementation was simple:

The device consists of a button, indicator LED and a 3D-printed adhesive bottle holding apparatus with a 55g servo motor fitted inside.  
A 1oz bottle of 3M adhesive was then wedged into the bottle holder.  To dispense a controlled amount of adhesive, the operator would hold the part
under the nozzle and press the button.  An LED indicator would turn on to let the operator know the dispenser is busy dispensing and would turn
off when ready to dispense again.

Instructions for wiring the device as well as making the program launch on power-up are located in the main Dispenser.py file.  
This was implemented on a RPi Zero W.
