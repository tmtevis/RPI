#	GENERAL INSTRUCTIONS:
#  To run program at startup:
#	1. Open terminal with Ctrl+Alt+T
#	2. type "sudo nano /etc/rc.local"
#	3. before "exit 0" line, add "sudo python /home/pi/Dispenser/DISPENSER.py" (or whatever the file path is for the new device/Raspberry Pi where this program is located)
#	4. hit Ctrl+X then ENTER to save/exit.
#	5. type "sudo reboot now" to test if Dispenser program begins at startup.
#
#  Physical Pin Map: (see pinout picture in TEMP-148 folder or type "pinout" in terminal)
#	Button (reversable, sides do not matter):
#		1st side: button to GPIO 11 (pin 23)
#		2nd side: button to 330 Ohm resistor to Raspberry Pi's 3.3V connection (pin 1 or pin 17)
#
#	LED (longer side is positive):
#		positive: LED to GPIO 23 (pin 16)
#		negative: LED to 330 Ohm resistor to Raspberry Pi's GND pin (pin 6, 9, 14, 20, 25, 30, 34 or 39)
#
#	Servo Motor (3 wires: red, brown, yellow):
#		Red (power): red wire to either of Raspberry Pi's 5V connections (pin 2 or 4)
#		Brown (GND): brown wire to any of Raspberry Pi's GND pins (pin 6, 9, 14, 20, 25, 30, 34 or 39)
#		Yellow (signal): yellow wire to GPIO 24 (pin 18)
